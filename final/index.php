<h1>Making the world a better place through games!</h1>
<h2>We make fantasy games</h2>
<p>Through our many games, name your player character and meet our vast variety of characters. In some games, you can free roam and explore the forest and swim through the rivers. In others, it's a visual novel where you play through like a pick your own adventure book. In all our games, there is the main story and small side stories for each character to get to know them better. If you like lore, dig through the many character and item bios to piece together the secrets of the world.</p>
<h2>Gacha system</h2>
<p>All our games have a gacha system, where you earn gems through playing the game and then try your luck on limited time banners to get newly introduced characters. You are always garanteed a special within 90 pulls! Most players have personal rituals that they do to increase their luck when summoning for their favorite characters, try some out and see if they will also work for you.</p>
